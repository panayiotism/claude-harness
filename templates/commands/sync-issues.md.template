Synchronize feature-list.json with GitHub Issues:

Requires GitHub MCP to be configured.

1. Use GitHub MCP to list open issues with label "feature"

2. For each GitHub issue NOT in feature-list.json:
   - Add new entry with:
     - id: Generate next feature-XXX
     - name: Issue title
     - description: Issue body (first paragraph)
     - priority: Based on labels (high=1, medium=2, low=3) or default 2
     - passes: false
     - verification: Extract from issue body if present, or generate
     - github.issueNumber: The issue number
     - github.prNumber: Check if PR exists linking this issue
     - github.branch: null (to be created when work starts)

3. For each feature in feature-list.json with passes=true:
   - If linked GitHub issue is still open, close it with comment
   - If linked PR is still open, check if merged

4. For each feature with github.issueNumber:
   - Verify issue still exists
   - Update any changed labels or priority

5. Report sync results:
   - New features imported
   - Issues closed
   - Any sync errors
