Check if code changes were made and committed\n\nRespond with JSON only (MUST include 'ok' boolean field):\n- If feature implementation just completed with passing tests: {\"ok\": true, \"action\": \"suggest_checkpoint\", \"feature\": \"feature-XXX\", \"reason\": \"Tests passed, ready for checkpoint\"}\n- If tests failed or work is incomplete: {\"ok\": true, \"action\": \"continue\", \"reason\": \"...\"}\n- If no active feature or not applicable: {\"ok\": true, \"action\": \"none\"}\n\nIMPORTANT: Always set ok=true to allow the stop to proceed.
