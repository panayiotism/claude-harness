      "description": "Integrate Mandelbrot set algorithms for escape-time supervision, fractal task decomposition, convergence detection, and bounded region analysis to improve orchestration efficiency and reliability. Implements: (1) Escape-time trajectory tracking to detect diverging agents before timeout, (2) Fractal self-similar decomposition for multi-scale task breakdown, (3) Fixed-point convergence detection for feedback loop termination, (4) Bounded region analysis for scope connectivity and parallelization safety, (5) Supervision tree with restart limits based on max_iteration principle.",
